Due to a number of local minimums, the gradient descent methods have difficulties in searching for the optimal
weights of artificial neural networks (ANNs). To resolve this problem, recently, a number of scholars have
conducted studies that utilize metaheuristics to optimize the weights of ANNs. Particularly, the swarm
intelligence algorithm which is one of the metaheuristics has shown great potential in previous studies. In this
study, we propose the hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that effectively optimizes the weight of ANNs by
combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO), both of which are swarm
intelligence algorithms. In the search process, the proposed algorithm resolves the convergence instability in the
validation dataset using the swarm memory that was inspired by the habit of remembering the environment in
which the swarm was suitable for survival. Numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed algorithm
outperforms the existing swarm intelligence algorithms, stochastic gradient descent, and Adam Optimizer in
terms of classification accuracy.
