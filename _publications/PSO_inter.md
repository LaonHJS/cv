Traffic congestion frequently occurs at multiple intersections with high vehicular traffic, particularly during rush hour. Inconsistent signal cycle lengths across intersections can hinder traffic flow, even when an upstream intersection grants a green light. To address this, the signal cycle lengths of multiple intersections should be
identical. Furthermore, practical constraints must be considered: (1) all signal times must be integers, (2) phase sequences should remain fixed to prevent accidents and driver confusion, and (3) pedestrian safety must be
ensured through sufficient crossing time. This paper proposes a novel particle swarm optimization-based method for optimizing traffic signals at multiple intersections, addressing the need for consistent signal cycle lengths and
the practical constraints. The proposed method was evaluated using the traffic simulator SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). Compared to existing signals, the proposed method reduced the average waiting time of
vehicles passing through multiple intersections by 10% during morning rush hour, 20% during normal hour, and 31% during evening rush hour.
