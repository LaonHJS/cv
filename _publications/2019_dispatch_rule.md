Recently, the semiconductor manufacturers have focused on the production of multiple chip products (MCPs) to
achieve high capacities while preserving compactness. As the number of chips to be stacked increases, a re-entrant
flow that repeats die attach and wire bonding assembly stages in MCP production is generated, which causes increased flow time and decreased resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a rule selection dispatcher (RSD)
based on an artificial neural network, which reduces the flow time and increases the resource utilization. RSD learns
the preferences of each dispatching rule according to assembly line data generated by a simulator. Then the proposed
dispatcher performs lot dispatching decisions by selecting one of the dispatching rules. The experiments showed that
the proposed dispatcher outperformed the existing methods in terms of the performance and computation time.
