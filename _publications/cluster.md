Because companies can obtain opinions and information of customers from reviews, they increasingly face the requirements of managing customer reviews on online platform. In this study, we analyze customers and carry out market segmentation for classifying and defining type of customers in e-commerce. Specifically, K-means clustering was conducted on customer review data collected from Wemakeprice online shopping platform, which leads to the result that six clusters were derived.
