Hello! I am an assistant professor in the Department of Business Administration at Tech University of Korea. With a background in industrial engineering, I specialize in smart manufacturing systems. My research interests lie in autonomous and intelligent manufacturing, where I actively engage in interdisciplinary work that bridges business management, industrial engineering, and AI-driven optimization techniques. 

Currently, I lead the Smart Factory Interdisciplinary Major. My research focuses on optimizing production systems, applying reinforcement learning to scheduling problems, and integrating discrete-event-based simulation into industrial environments.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about education and curriculum development, particularly in designing courses that help students explore their roles in society, set academic goals, and develop essential competencies. I also have a deep interest in projects ranging from cryptocurrency trading bots to simulation-based problem-solving in manufacturing.

On this website, I share insights on my research, teaching, and technical projects. If you are interested in collaborations, academic discussions, or simply exchanging ideas, feel free to reach out!
